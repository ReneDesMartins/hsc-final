# Feasibility Report

## Technical Feasibility
The project is not overly complex to build. Although Ruby isn't my primary language when it comes to programming, I have ample time to learn more about the language and its features in terms of its use with Sinatra and ERB, while also having the time to build the application. The use of the Ruby language also allows me to use [Heroku][1], a free Ruby app hosting platform. The dedicated support for Ruby and Sinatra in particular provides good documentation for the server as well as possible integration with the Heroku API itself.

## Schedule Feasibility
The project should be finished within the time constraints, as I am building a relatively simple web application. The main difficulty will be in implementing the database and other such things within the domain of Ruby as opposed to raw SQL. I will also have to learn the use of Sinatra (Ruby on Rails is far too complex for a simple web app) and how to integrate it with HTML. Sinatra is designed as a lightweight framework to build web apps quickly, which means that I will be able to handle the back-end of the application very quickly. All in all, time constraints are a relatively minor concern, and the project is feasible in terms of time constraints.

## Economic Feasibility
The project effectively has a zero budget, meaning that I have to use only free tools in my project. Despite this limitation, most of the tools I have planned are entirely free and open source to boot. Ruby and Sinatra are free, as well as all the gems hosted on [Rubygems][2]. The major expenditure that would usually be involved in terms of server hosting can be circumvented with the use of Heroku web hosting, which is free. Despite the fact that the apps can only be online for 16 hours, this should be enough. This makes sure that the entire project can be completed without any need for monetary expenditure.
